# Hex Batch

## A tiny organization with huge ideas!
Currently, in progress for first releases.  

## Making entirely new ways to interact online
* A firm believer in the rights of tiny virtual animals and plants to inhabit your browser pages, and travel from home to home.

## Goals

- Trying to find my groove
- Set up an online library (set of api calls) that can be used for my own projects.
 
## Current projects, or plans for those

- an open source library that combines sets, types, elements and networking. Apache license
- visual sandbox to try out the core, Apache license
- a second tier libary that uses the first, and defines ways to interact with others, Apache license
- a third tier library that is proprietary

## Visons
- Have a new way to do online contracts, collaborations
- The power of the core 1 and 2 projects is that they acts like a glue, able to connect and combine unrelated projects and online resources
  - Allow for greater operability between different systems. 
- Trying to create virtual ecosystems of plant and animal analogues that travel between browers and apps, processing and delivery information
  - Things are so fast now on the internet, that it is time for some inefficient and slow code to do powerful things
