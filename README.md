# Hex Batch

## A tiny organization with huge ideas!
Nothing here works at this time. There is nothing to see here. There are not yet any demos, strict api definitions, or easy to read text. This will change.

## Making entirely new ways to interact online
* A firm believer in the rights of tiny virtual animals and plants to inhabit your web browser pages, and travel from home to home.
* Arrogant enough to think that the current social web can be made better, in very specific ways that are hazily defined

## Goals

- Allow a seamless user experience between any web pages on the browser, and things elsewhere.
- Have a new way to do online contracts.
- Help make a start for new open sourced, federated systems to trade goods and services.
- Inside this new space grow viritual ecosystems that process data, and distribute info, much like a food web.
- Allow for greater operability betweeen different systems.
 
## Current projects, or plans for those

- a open source library that combines sets, types, elements and networking.
- a second tier libary that uses the first, and defines ways to interact with others
